My topic of research will be "House Price Prediction in chicago,IL". Since housing market is in the uptrend since last few years and with so many macro economic changes, it's difficult to understand the trend in future and i would like to address this issue using Data science and predict the housing price movement. The goal was to predict the price of a given apartment according to the market prices taking into account different “features” that will be developed in the following sections. Lot of different questions can be answered using the model . for example, how is the interest rate change impacts the house price how the first time buyers impacting the house price change. The impact of job movement from major cities on housing price. the impact working pattern of professional on housing market.
